POST /api/auth/register
POST /api/auth/login
POST /api/auth/logout

// Shipments
POST /api/shipments/request
GET /api/shipments
GET /api/shipments/:id
PUT /api/shipments/:id/status

// Analytics
GET /api/analytics/dashboard
GET /api/analytics/savings

// AI Integration
POST /api/ai/optimize-route
POST /api/ai/match-shipments
```

### Database Schema (MongoDB)
```javascript
// User Schema
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  email: String,
  name: String,
  businessName: String,
  role: String,
  createdAt: Date
}

// Shipment Schema
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  userId: ObjectId,
  title: String,
  pickupLocation: String,
  dropoffLocation: String,
  goodsType: String,
  weight: Number,
  status: String, // Processing, Pending, In Transit, Delivered
  eta: String,
  cost: Number,
  savings: Number,
  route_data: {
    distance: String,
    stops: Number,
    sharedWith: String
  },
  createdAt: Date,
  updatedAt: Date
}
```

### AI Service Integration (Python)
```python
# Proposed AI optimization endpoint
@app.route('/optimize', methods=['POST'])
def optimize_route():
    """
    Receives shipment details and returns:
    - Optimized route
    - Estimated time of arrival
    - Cost calculation
    - Shared delivery opportunities
    - Environmental impact metrics
    """
    pass
```
